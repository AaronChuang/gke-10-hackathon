## üåü About This Project (GKE Turns 10 Hackathon)

This project was created for the **GKE Turns 10 Hackathon** (September 12 - September 22, 2025). Our goal was to enhance the **Online Boutique** sample application with Agentic AI capabilities without modifying its core source code. We achieved this by building an independent, injectable JavaScript widget powered by a robust, GKE-hosted AI microservices backend.

* **Non-Invasive Integration:** A single `<script>` tag injects an "AI Stylist" into the Online Boutique product pages, demonstrating a clean, decoupled, and scalable integration pattern.
* **Powered by GKE:** The entire backend, from the intelligent orchestrator to the specialized AI agents and the management dashboard, is containerized and runs on a GKE Autopilot cluster for hands-off, optimized infrastructure management.
* **Leveraging Google AI:** The system's intelligence is powered by Google's Gemini models via Vertex AI, with a RAG implementation using Vector Search to provide grounded, context-aware responses.

## üë• Our Team: A Human-AI Collaboration

This project was brought to life through a unique development methodology, pairing a human developer with a team of advanced AI assistants. This hybrid approach allowed for rapid prototyping, complex problem-solving, and sophisticated code generation.

* **Human Developer (Aaron Chen):** Acted as the project lead, architect, and strategist. Responsible for defining the vision, making key architectural decisions, and performing final code implementation and debugging.
* **AI Partner (Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro):** Served as the primary co-programmer and systems analyst. Responsible for generating complex code blocks (Kubernetes YAML, Python backend logic, Preact/Vue components), writing detailed technical specifications, and providing in-depth debugging suggestions.
* **AI Partner (Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet):** Acted as a conceptual sparring partner and code refactoring specialist, responsible for brainstorming alternative approaches and improving code readability.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **ü§ñ Dynamic Agent Ecosystem:** An intelligent orchestrator routes tasks to a pool of specialist agents (`Stylist`, `Tech Analyst`, etc.), with the ability to dynamically create and manage agents via a UI.
* **üß† Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** All agent responses are strictly grounded in a knowledge base created by ingesting external websites, preventing factual invention and ensuring relevance.
* **üìä Comprehensive Monitoring Dashboard:** A Vue 3 dashboard provides real-time task monitoring, agent management, and knowledge base control, powered by a live connection to Firestore.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Intelligent Guardrails System:** Includes mechanisms like a two-retry termination policy to prevent infinite loops and detailed token consumption tracking for cost analysis.
